# Jolly
A jolly simple python-based onepage webserver that serves a simple text file

## Instructions
1. Add your web page contents to the main.txt text file (text only, of course!)
2. Run Jolly by navigating to it in a terminal/ command prompt window and type either 'python3 srv.py' or if you are running Linux './start.sh'

It's that simple!
